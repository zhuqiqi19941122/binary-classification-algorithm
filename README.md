Bank Precision Marketing Solutions-- using Logistic Regression and Tree Algorithms
Precision marketing makes sense for sellers and banks. Selecting a suitable user group for promotion, on the one hand, reduces the cost of promotion, and on the other hand increases the possibility of promotion success. In this project, we use a dataset from the [Bank Precision Marketing Solutions competiton](https://www.kesci.com/home/competition/5c234c6626ba91002bfdfdd3/content/0) on kesci and predict the probability of user purchase.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [online Dataset](https://www.kesci.com/home/competition/5c234c6626ba91002bfdfdd3/content/2) which contains property information of 25317 clients. 
## Learning algorithms used
Logistic Regression;
Support Vector Machine;
Decision Trees;
Random Forest;
## Evaluation Methods
To evaluate the performance of each model, we used the ROC AUC Score. Learn more about ROC curves and AUC [here](https://www.dataschool.io/roc-curves-and-auc-explained/).
## Results
