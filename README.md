Bank Precision Marketing Solutions-- using Logistic Regression and Tree Algorithms
Precision marketing makes sense for sellers and banks. Selecting a suitable user group for promotion, on the one hand, reduces the cost of promotion, and on the other hand increases the possibility of promotion success. In this project, we use a dataset from the Bank Precision Marketing Solutions competiton on Kaggle and evaluate methods for CTR prediction.
