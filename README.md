Bank Precision Marketing Solutions-- using Logistic Regression and Tree Algorithms
Precision marketing makes sense for sellers and banks. Selecting a suitable user group for promotion, on the one hand, reduces the cost of promotion, and on the other hand increases the possibility of promotion success. In this project, we use a dataset from the [Bank Precision Marketing Solutions competiton] (https://www.kesci.com/home/competition/5c234c6626ba91002bfdfdd3/content/0) on kesci and predict the probability of user purchase.
